Reddit Videos

This is a Plex plugin to browse and watch videos from reddit. You can manually enter in subreddits, or browse hard-coded categories.

Installation:

I have only installed this on Windows 7 so far.  It should work anywhere you can install Plex Media Server, though.
The redditvideos.bundle needs to be placed in your plug-ins folder.  This is a folder within your Plex Media Server
folders.
On Windows 7, that folder is located in a location similar to this
\Users\(Your User Name Here)\AppData\Local\Plex Media Server\Plug-ins
