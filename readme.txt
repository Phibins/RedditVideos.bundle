Reddit Videos

This is the official Reddit Videos Plex plugin development git.
Current Features:
Manually Enter any subreddit to look for videos.
Maintain a list of customizable favorite subreddits.
Browse hard-coded subreddits.
View the most popular videos from specific domains like youtube.com or ted.com irrespective of subreddit.

Installation:

This can be installed directly from Plex.  Some of the changes noted here may not be available immediately until
the changes have been merged with Plex's github account.

If this plugin bundle is placed in Plex Media Server's Plug-ins folder, it will most likely be automatically reverted to the official Plex Reddit Videos version.  I'd recommend changing the name of the plug-in or seeing
if you have better luck using a symbolic link to the bundle that will be outside of the folder where Plex automatically makes changes.
