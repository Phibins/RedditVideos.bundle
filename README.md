##Reddit Videos 
*This is the official Reddit Videos Plex plugin development git.*

###Current Features:
* Manually Enter any subreddit to look for videos.
* Maintain a list of customizable favorite subreddits.
* Browse hard-coded subreddits.
* View the most popular videos from specific domains like youtube.com or ted.com irrespective of subreddit.
* Store and delete custom favorite subreddits within the app
* Sort the subreddits by hot, new, or top (all time, month, week, day, and hour)

###Upcoming Features:
* Categories automatically updated and replaced by multireddits
* Support for images
* Automatic playlist creation (not sure if possible)
* View comments for individual videos
* User authentication

###Installation:
This can be installed directly from Plex.  Some of the changes noted here may not be available immediately until the changes have been merged with Plex's github account.

If this plugin bundle is placed in Plex Media Server's Plug-ins folder, it will most likely be automatically reverted to the official Plex Reddit Videos version.  If you want to install the latest development version, install the [Reddit Videos Dev repository](https://github.com/seagullcanfly/RedditVideosDev) instead.
